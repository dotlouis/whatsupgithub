Ok, this one is not open source, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I should not tell you about it because it‚Äôs very cool.  
Here‚Äôs what [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw) has to say about it:

> Getting and sharing info about someone‚Äôs browser is janky as heck, so I made a new product to change that.

‚ÄúOh, I need to get that marketing email to look good. It‚Äôs only going to take me a few minute.‚Äù said‚Ä¶ no. one. ever.  
MJML is a markup language created by Mailjet and designed to reduce the pain of coding a responsive email. You write in MJML and the engine transpiles it to email-client ready HTML.

This one‚Äôs a gem. As a developer, you know how much you love fonts and how much you hate them at the same time. Yes, they‚Äôre beautiful, but gosh how much can they cost you!  
Put simply subfont is going to analyze your whole codebase and find which glyphs are used and which aren‚Äôt.  
Then it will recreate the font file without all the unnecessary characters saving you precious bits of data.
