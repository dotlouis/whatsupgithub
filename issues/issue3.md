# What's up Github - Issue #3

It’s been 2 months since my last issue 😱.  
So I included a lot more great Github projects I’ve found during this time!  
Here’s my top repositories

✍🏻 **It has never been so easy to document your things!**

Okay, who has ever used screenshots, Google Doc, Confluence or similar to document code. ☝️I have and it felt bad. Documentation saves tons of time to consumers but it has been a pain for producers. Docz is game-changing thanks to the cleanness of markdown, ease of importing `<Components>` (yes `import` like in your JS files) and some cool tricks to generate menus, props-table and more.

📷 **Complete set of Instagram filters in pure CSS**

Yes I know, you will not create yet another Instagram clone. But admit it, these CSS filters look good. How far have CSS come since float: right ? 🙃

🔮 **Enabling Machine Learning driven user-experiences on the web (and for NextJS)**

Machine-Learning. Yeah we know it’s changing everything. In the meantime, I’m still writing `git puhs` in my terminal without it being autocorrected. Oh well. So Guess.js is a collection tools to simplify predictive data-analytics driven approaches to improving user-experiences on the web. Applied to NextJS It gives smarter pre-fetching of routes based on user navigation patterns. Early benchmarks show 20% improvement in perceived page load performance.

![want this for your create-vue-app-ssr-typescript-parcel CLI bootstrap tool ?](https://s3.amazonaws.com/revue/items/images/003/502/255/original/prompts.gif?1537023693)

❯ **Lightweight, beautiful and user-friendly interactive prompts**

CLI tools are 🔥these days, with the growing tooling that paradoxically simplify and complexity web development at the same time. So if you’re into that, you can build better prompts for your own CLI with this cool library.

♠️ **MDX-based presentation decks**

I love Markdown. It’s clean and easy to read and, most of all, to write. Now you can create presentation decks with it. And you can of course import real, working React components into your slides. Next time you make a presentation about your `<Button>`, forget screenshots, use this. And quit using cat pictures.

[dylanbeattie/rockstar](https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar)

🎸 **The Rockstar programming language specification**

This one is pure genius. Have you ever cringed when hearing someone mention a “rockstar programmer”. Fear not. I know you want to be one as well. And now, you can. Using expressions such as Poetic literals, you can write things like:

> My heart is true

which initialises the variable my heart with the Boolean value true

[virtualagc/virtualagc](https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc)

🚀 **Virtual Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) software**

A nice little one. For historic and simulation purposes, The Apollo Digital Archeology project uploaded the source code of the Apollo Guidance Computer used to power the guidance system of the Lunar Module and Command Module of multiple Apollo missions from late 1960’s and early 1970’.
