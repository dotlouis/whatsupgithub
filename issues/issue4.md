# What's up Github - Issue #4

Hello folks,  
📬 I’m still trying to find my sweet spot in terms of publishing frequency. I think I’m starting to enjoy posting once every two weeks. It gives me time to gather cool projects without having to “fill” the newsletter just to write something.  
With that said, here are my picks:

![xi-editor](https://s3.amazonaws.com/revue/items/images/003/652/367/original/xi-mac-screenshot.png?1539418787)

⌨️ [xi-editor/xi-editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor)

If, like me, you’re new to Rust and wish you had the opportunity to take a closer look at it, this code editor, created in 2016 is a (relatively) simple project to start playing around. The xi-editor project is an attempt to build a high quality text editor, using modern software engineering techniques to achieve: _“Incredibly high performance, beauty, reliability and developer friendliness”_

🎥 [wulkano/kap](https://github.com/wulkano/kap)

I know, there are like a zillions apps out there to record your screen. But this one is open source, and it’s powered by Javascript. Kap is based on [aperture](https://github.com/wulkano/aperture), a screen recorder in Swift with a JS wrapper. It’s also very clean, simple and intuitive. For all the non-mojave folks out there !

⏰ [iamkun/dayjs](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs)

`const foo = new Date(2012, 1, 1) // February 1rst, 2012.`

This is the reason I don’t fiddle with JS dates myself. At this point everyone in the Javascript worlds knows and has used Moment.js. But one knows it could be overkill: it’s 227kB minified. which is 2.5 times jQuery! Dayjs is only 6.6kB minified and is immutable, to avoid further date manipulation quirks.

Note: _I feel we should use jQuery as a unit of size 😁_

𝗠𝗱 [djyde/markbox](https://github.com/djyde/markbox)

If you’ve read [my last issue](https://github.com/dotlouis/whatsupgithub/blob/master/issues/issue3.md), you know I really like markdown for its simplicity yet powerful approach to content editing/reading. Until now you could add code snippets by using the triple back-ticks “` notation. But this code was just static text, nothing more. Markbox allows you to parse those snippets and transform them into a living codesandbox embed. Which means you can have your code and the running result side by side in your documentation. Your README is now 120% better.

➗ [Jam3/math-as-code](https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code)

Ok, Math, we have to talk. Every non-tech person is thinking I know you well, while the reality is that, I would LIKE to know you better. Let’s change that. This project helps you understand Math notations by giving you the equivalent code syntax. It works surprisingly well, and relieve my frown when looking at math expressions.
